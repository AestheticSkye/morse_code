## Compiling
To compile the program, the thumbv6m-none-eabi toolchain is required
```shell
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
```
To convert the ELF into a UF2 file, elf2uf2-rs is required
```shell
cargo install elf2uf2-rs
```
Once these are installed, plug the pico in while holding the BOOTSEL button and run `cargo run`

To get the executable instead, run `cargo build` then `elf2uf2-rs target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/morse_code`
